Inferring dust extinction parameters from realistic galaxy images using CNNs

This project explores whether convolutional neural networks can learn physically meaningful dust extinction parameters from noisy simulated galaxy images.

The simulations are inspired by my PhD work on circumgalactic dust extinction and use GalSim to generate realistic imaging data including PSF convolution and noise.
